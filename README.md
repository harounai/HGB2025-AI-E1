# Part 1 — Environment Setup and Basics

## 1. Start the environment

Download the repository and start the environment:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## 2. Access PostgreSQL

```bash
docker exec -it pg-bigdata psql -U postgres
```

## 3. Load and query data in PostgreSQL

### 3.1 Create a large dataset

```bash
cd data
python3 expand.py
```

Creates `data/people_1M.csv` with ~1 million rows.

```bash
wc -l people_1M.csv
```

### 3.2 Enter PostgreSQL

```bash
docker exec -it pg-bigdata psql -U postgres
```

### 3.3 Create and load the table

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS people_big;

CREATE TABLE people_big (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  gender TEXT,
  department TEXT,
  salary INTEGER,
  country TEXT
);

\COPY people_big(first_name,last_name,gender,department,salary,country)
FROM '/data/people_1M.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

### 3.4 Enable timing

```sql
\timing on
```

## 4. Verification

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM people_big;
SELECT * FROM people_big LIMIT 10;
```

## 5. Analytical queries

### (a) Simple aggregation

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM people_big
GROUP BY department;
```

### (b) Nested aggregation

```sql
SELECT country, AVG(avg_salary)
FROM (
  SELECT country, department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
  FROM people_big
  GROUP BY country, department
) sub
GROUP BY country;
```

### (c) Top-N sort

```sql
SELECT *
FROM people_big
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
